## Fail fast, Fail Early
- [What does the expression "Fail Early" mean, and when would you want to do so?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2807241/what-does-the-expression-fail-early-mean-and-when-would-you-want-to-do-so)

Essentially, fail fast (a.k.a. fail early) is to code your software such that, when there is a problem, the software fails as soon as and as visibly as possible, rather than trying to proceed in a possibly unstable state.

It means: "Catch bugs as early as possible".
